# :zap: React Social Auth Components
What we are going to have here, are ready to use <b>Auth Components</b>. The Component will be rendering nothing more than a simple <button>. On click the user will be redirected to the corresponding Social Networking Service provider.. be it Facebook, Google, Github etc. After successfull login the user should be redirected back to our <b>Client App</b> with a `token<` or a `code<`( for Github )
